                </header>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Tennessee and lived there for for 24 years.I have one older sister named Chelsey.
                    When i was in high school I realized I have a passion for computer programming. I decided to go to college to learn more about
                    it.  While I was in college, I worked at Publix for 3 years as a cashier.  I spent 5 years learning about computer programming
                    and got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I later moved to Missouri to be closer to my boyfriend.  He told me of a program
                    called LaunchCode that i can take to gain more experience with programming.  I am enjoying every day that we spend time together
                    my boyfriend and I.

                <h2>Hobbies! </h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many different hobbies taht I do when im bored.  My first hobby is playing video games and trying to get every single
                    item in the game (including trophies if available).  I play almost all types of games except most shooting games and sport games.
                    I owe so many different systems of vidoe games and I enjoy them all.  My second hobby is reading books.  I enjoy reading mystery,
                    fantasy, and romance books.  I read most of my books on my kindle, but I also own some in hard and paperback.  My third hobby
                    painting and coloring.  I enjoy doing paint-by-numbers or color-by-numbers or any thing related to it.  I don't draw too much
                    but any drawing that are done I like to paint or color it in.  Another hobby I have is working on puzzles.  I enjoy working on
                    puzzles then glueing them together and hanging them up on the wall.

                <h2> Favorite Animals! </h3>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many types of animals that I love.  My first favorite animal is tigers.  I like white tigers more than orange ones.
                    My next favoriate animal is dolphins.  I also like cats and dogs when they are all cute and cuddly and not jumping on me
